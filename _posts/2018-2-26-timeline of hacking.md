Hacking began in the 1960s at MIT when students attempted to learn more about mainframe computing systems and
improve their skills.


The telephone systems were tempting to phreakers, and John Draper, known as Captain Crunch, used a whistle 
packaged in Captain Crunch cereal to generate a 2600 Hertz tone that allowed access to AT&T long distance
network. This discovery led to Draper and other designing and building a so-called ‘blue box’ that generated
2600 Hertz signal and other tones for use in making long distance phone calls without paying. Steve Jobs & 
Steve Wozniak, who later founded Apple Technologies, were also the makers of Blue Boxes.

In the 1980s, hackers began to share information and stolen passwords on electronic computer bulletin boards such
as “Sherwood Forest”. Hacking clubs began to form with names like the German “Chaos Computer Club”. In 1982, 
teenagers in Wisconsin, known as 414 Gang, launched attacks into Sloan Kettering Cancer Hospital’s Medical records
systems. Two years later, the hacker magazine 2600 made its debut under editor Eric Corley, aka Emmanuel Goldstein.
In November 1988, the Morris Internet Worm spread through the Internet and resulted in large scale Denial of 
Service(DoS attacks). The cause of this Disruption was a small program written by Robert Tappan Morris, a 23 years
old doctoral student at Cornell University. The worm infected approximately 6,000 networked computers.

In 1986, attacks were launched against U.S. classified computer systems by Germans affiliated with the Chaos 
Computer Club and working for the KGB. In 1990, a hacker named Kevin Poulson, with some associates, hacked a
radio station’s phone system to ensure they won a  call-in contest for Porsches and other prizes. Poulson,
who was also wanted for phreaking, was apprehended and sentenced to five years in prison. He was released
in 1996.

The first hacking conference, called Def Con, was held in Las Vegas in 1993 and is still held annually. If you
want to know more about hacking, I suggest you watch the videos of Def Con. You might be knowing about
Kevin Mitnick. He was one of the most notorious hackers of his times. On Christmas 1995, he broke into the 
computers of Tsutomu Shimomura in San Diego, California. Shimomura tracked down Mitnick after a cross country
electronic pursuit, and he was arrested by FBI in Raleigh, North Carolina, on February 15, 1995. Mitnick pleaded guilty
to charges at his trial in March 1999, and his sentence was nearly equal to his time served. He is now an independent 
security consultant and author.


Then after, in 1995, Russian Hacker Vladimir Leven and associates performed electronic transfer of 10 Million Dollars
to a number of international banks. Leven was captured and tried in U.S. and sentenced to three years confinement.
In 1998, “The Cult of the Dead Cow” announced and released very effective Trojan Horse software called Back Orfice
at Def Con. Back Orfice provided remote access to Windows 98 & Windows 95 computers. In February 2000, hackers launched
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against Yahoo, Amazon, and ZDnet. Microsoft Corporation’s Network was
hacked in October 2000 by an attacker who gained access to Software under Development. The “Symantec Internet Security
Threat Report” published in September 2006 confirmed the increase of the targeted and profit-driven attacks by saying
that attacks on financial targets had increased by approximately 350 percent in the first half of 2006 over the 
preceding six month period. Attacks on the home user declined by approximately 7 percent in that same period.
The hacker community is changing.

Over the last two to three years, hackers motivation has changed from just the thrill of figuring out how to exploit
vulnerabilities to figuring out how to make revenue from their actions and getting paid for their skills. Hackers
who were out to “have fun” without any real targeted victims in mind have been largely replaced by people who are
serious about reaping financial benefits from their activities. The attacks are not only were getting more specific
but also increasing in sophistication. This is why many people believe that the spread of malware has declined over
time malware that sends a “shotgun blast” of software to as many systems as it can bring no financial benefit to
the bad guys compared with malware that zeros in on a victim for a more strategic attack.

The year 2006 has been called the “Year of the Rootkit” because of the growing use of rootkits, which allowed hackers
to attack specific targets without much risk of being identified. Much antivirus and anti-malware cannot detect
rootkits as specific tools are used to detect rootkits, so while the vendors say that they have malware more under
control, it is rather that the hackers are changing their ways of doing business. Both Ameritrade and E-Trade
Financial, two of the top five online brokerage services, confirmed that millions of dollars had been lost to 
(or stolen by) hacker attacks on their systems in the third quarter of 2006. Investigations by the SEC, FBI, and
Secret Service have been initiated as a result. Apple computers, which had been relatively untargeted by hackers due
to their smaller market share, are becoming the focus of more attacks. Identified vulnerabilities in the MAC OS X 
increased by almost 400 percent from 2004 to 2006, but still, make up only a small percentage of the total of known
vulnerabilities. In another product line, Apple reported that some of their iPods shipped in late 2006 were infected
with the RavMonE.exe virus. The virus was thought to have been introduced into the production line through another 
company that builds the iPods for Apple.

In December 2006, a 26-year-old Romanian man was indicted by U.S. courts on nine counts of computer intrusion and
one count of conspiracy regarding breaking into more than 150 U.S. government computer systems at the Jet Propulsion
Labs, the Goddard Space Flight Center, Sandia National Laboratories, and the U.S. Naval Observatory. The intrusion
cost the U.S. government nearly $150 million in damages. The accused faces up to 54 years in prison if convicted 
on all counts. In Symantec’s “Internet Security Threat Report, Volume X,” released in September 2006, they reported
the detection of over 150,000 new, unique phishing messages over a six-month period from January 2006 through June
2006, up 81 percent over the same reporting period from the previous year. Symantec detected an average of 6,110
denial of service (DoS) attacks per day, the United States being the most prevalent target of attacks (54 percent)
and the most prolific source of attacks (37 percent) worldwide. Networks in China, and specifically Beijing, are 
identified as being the most bot-infected and compromised on the planet.

On September 25, 2007, hackers posted names, credit card numbers, as well as Card Verification Value (CVV) 
Codes and addresses of eBay customers on a forum that was specifically created for fraud prevention by the 
auction site. The information was available for more than an hour to anyone that visited the forum before 
it was taken down. A security breach at Pfizer on September 4, 2007, may have publicly exposed the names,
social security numbers, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, credit card information, signatures, bank
account numbers, and other personal information of 34,000 employees. The breach occurred in 2006 but was not
noticed by the company until July 10, 2007. On August 23, 2007, the names, addresses, and phone numbers of 
around 1.6 million job seekers were stolen from Monster.com. On February 8, 2007, Consumeraffairs.com reported 
that identity theft had topped the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC’s) complaint list for the seventh year in a 
row. Identity theft complaints accounted for 36 percent of the 674,354 complaints that were received by the
FTC in the period between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2006.

Privacyrights.org has reported that the total number of records containing sensitive information that have
been involved in security breaches from January 10, 2005, to September 28, 2007, numbers 166,844,653. Clay 
High School in Oregon, Ohio, reported on January 25, 2007, that staff and student information had been obtained
through a security breach by a former student. The data had been copied to an iPod and included names, social 
security numbers, birth dates, phone numbers, and addresses. The theft of a portable hard drive from an employee
of the U. S. Department of Veteran’s Affairs, VA Medical Center in Birmingham, Alabama, resulted in the potential
exposure of nearly a million VA patients’ data, as well as more than $20 million being spent in response to the
data breach.

In April 2007, a woman in Nebraska was able to use TurboTax online to access not only her previous tax returns
but the returns for other TurboTax customers in different parts of the country. This information contained things
like social security numbers, personal information, bank account numbers, and routing digits that would have been
provided when e-filing. A security contractor for Los Alamos National Laboratory sent critical and sensitive 
information on nuclear materials over open, unsecured e-mail networks in January 2007—a security failing ranked
among the top of serious threats against national security interests or critical Department of Energy assets. 
Several Los Alamos National Security officials apparently used open and insecure e-mail networks to share classified
information pertaining to nuclear material in nuclear weapons on January 19, 2007. Carnegie Mellon University’s Computer
Emergency Response Team (CERT) shows in its cyberterrorism study that the bad guys are getting smarter, more resourceful,
and seemingly unstoppable, so what will companies need to do to properly protect themselves from these types of 
incidents and business risks? In 2006, an increasing number of companies felt that security was the number one concern 
of senior management. Protection from the attack was their highest priority, followed by proprietary data protection, 
then customer and client privacy, and finally regulatory compliance issues.

Telecommuting, mobile devices, public terminals, and thumb drives are viewed as principal sources of unauthorized data
access and data theft but are not yet covered in most corporate security policies and programs. The FBI has named computer
crimes as their third priority. The 203-page document that justifies its 2008 fiscal year budget request to Congress
included a request for $258.5 million to fund 659 field agents. This is a 1.5 percent increase over the 2007 fiscal
year. IT budgets, staffing, and salaries were expected to increase during the year 2007 according to a survey of CIOs
and IT executives conducted by the Society for Information Management. In February 2007, Forrester.com reported in a 
teleconference that the firms they had surveyed were planning on spending between 7.5 percent and 9.0 percent of their
IT budgets on security. These figures were fairly consistent among different organizations, regardless of their industry,
size, and geographic location. In May 2007 they reported that more than half of the IT directors they had surveyed were
planning on increasing their security budgets.

 
As stated earlier, an interesting shift has taken place in the hacker community—from joyriding to hacking as an occupation.
Today close to a million computers are infected with bots that are controlled by specific hackers. If a hacker has 
infected 4,000 systems, he or she can use her bot network to carry out DoS attacks or lease these systems to others.
Botnets are used to spread more spam, phishing attacks, and pornography. Hackers who own and run botnets are referred
to as bot herders, and they lease out systems to others who do not want their activities linked to their true identities
or systems. Since more network administrators have properly configured their mail relays, and blacklists are used to block
mail relays that are open, spammers have had to move to different methods(using botnets), which the hacking community has
been more than willing to provide for a price.

On January 23, 2006, “BotHerder” Jeanson James Ancheta, 21, of Downey, California, a member of the “botmaster underground,”
pleaded guilty to fraudulently installing adware and then selling zombies to hackers and spammers. “BotHerder” was sentenced
on May 8, 2006, with a record prison sentence of 57 months (nearly five years) in federal prison. At the time of sentencing,
it was the first prosecution of its kind in the United States and was the longest known sentence for a defendant who had 
spread computer viruses. A drastic increase in spam was experienced in the later months of 2006 and early part of 2007 
because spammers embedded images with their messages instead of using the traditional text. This outwitted almost all of
the spam filters, and many people around the world experienced a large surge in spam.

So what does this all have to do with ethics? As many of you might know, the term “hacker” had a positive connotation in the
1980s and early 1990s. It was a name for someone who really understood systems and software, but it did not mean that they 
were carrying out malicious activities. As malware and attacks emerged, the press and the industry equated the term “hacker”
with someone who carries out malicious technical attacks. Just as in the rest of life, where good and evil are constantly 
trying to outwit each other, there are good hackers (ethical) and bad hackers (unethical).
