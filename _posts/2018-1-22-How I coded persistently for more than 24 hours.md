The practice of coding is one of teaching the computer to do something. The purpose of programming is to create. 
The languages, machines, compilers and interpreters are only tools; brushes to painters. Some guys think that it's
very difficult to do.... But that's not the case.... If you love it, then you can do it for a year !!!! 
Don't take it seriously.... I was just kidding. But Yeah, It's not that easy too.

I have code many of my projects but not persistently. I used to take a break in between & then continued. 
But, just a few hours ago, I coded persistently for more than 24 hours in Java. It was really a tough task,
However, I loved it. Not more than creating the web projects. They are really great & useful. This one is
little bit less good than those.

Actually, I was required to complete an assignment given to me. The task was to create a document containing
source codes of programs asked in last 10 years of ISC Board's Examinations. At first I thought, that's an easy
task. As, I would just go & search on Google & then just copy-paste from its sources. But then, one of my friend
suggested him that I should write the codes on my own as it would train my skills.... At first, I didn't took 
him seriously. But after few hours, I thought that he may be right. So, I decided that as I'm still a beginner
to Java, I should write it my self. So, after approx. 2 hours from then, I begin to code. With my Laptop, 
Headphones, Linux Terminal, Alan Walker's Radio on Youtube, JIO's Internet Connection & cans of Coke. 

First few hours were quite boring as the programs asked in Theory were not that good. They were
too easy to do. Especially the ones asked in recent years. But, when I switched to Practical Questions, 
they were amazing. Each took quite a time. Lot of thinking was required especially while reducing the
Time & Space Complexities. The Coding Part was all over a fun. But when It came to commenting it
with the respective questions, it was really a boring stuff. However, I did it & At last, I created 
the Introduction page with some of my ASCII arts. 

Since then, I have been coding for this long in my bed bunk & assignment has now been completed.
And I have just published my last 24 hours experience here & I'm now feeling drowsy.
So, That's It !!! Now I'm going to sleep.

The assignment is available on [Github](https://github.com/thegeeq/ISCCodes)<br>
PDF's can be downloaded from [Github Releases](https://github.com/thegeeq/ISCCodes/releases)

Good Bye ;-)
