Today computer networks are everywhere. You will find them in homes, offices, factories, hospitals leisure centres etc.
But how are they created? What technologies do they use? So, let's start.

A **Network** connects computers, mobile phones, peripherals, and even IoT devices. Tt is s a set of computers 
connected together for the purpose of sharing resources. Each computer on the network is called a node.Switches, 
routers, and wireless access points are the essential networking basics. Through them, devices connected to 
your network can communicate with one another and with other networks, like the Internet. It's the practice of 
linking multiple computing devices together  in order to share resources. These resources can be printers, 
CDs, files, or even electronic communications such as e-mails and instant messages. These networks can be created 
using several different methods, such as cables, telephone lines, satellites, radio waves, and infrared beams. 
Without the ability to network, businesses, government agencies, and schools would be unable to operate as 
efficiently as they do today. The ability for an office or school to connect 
dozens of computers to a single printer is a seemingly simple, yet extremely useful capability. Perhaps even more valuable 
is the ability to access the same data files from various computers throughout a building. This is incredibly useful for 
companies that may have files that require access by multiple employees daily. By utilizing networking, those same files 
could be made available to several employees on separate computers simultaneously, improving efficiency.

When it comes to networking, there are two essential pieces of equipment that enable numerous devices to be connected: *Routers* 
and *Switches*.

## Switches

**Switches** are used in order to connect many devices on the same network. These devices are generally within the 
same building, such as an office building or school and could consist of various computers, printers, and other gadgets. 
The switch acts as a controller, allowing the connected objects to share information with one another. This not only 
increases productivity and efficiency, but also saves money. Switches are the foundation of most business networks. 
Switches allow devices on your network to communicate with each other, as well as with other networks, creating a network
of shared resources. Through information sharing and resource allocation, switches save money and increase productivity.
There are two basic types of switches to choose from as part of your networking basics: *managed* and *unmanaged*.
 1. An **unmanaged switch** works out of the box but can't be configured. Home-networking equipment typically offers unmanaged switches.
 2. A **managed switch** can be configured. You can monitor and adjust a managed switch locally or remotely, giving you greater control 
    over network traffic and access.

## Routers

**Routers** connect multiple networks together. They also connect computers on those networks to the Internet. 
Routers enable all networked computers to share a single Internet connection, which saves money. A router acts a 
dispatcher. It analyzes data being sent across a network, chooses the best route for data to travel, and sends it on its way.
Routers connect your business to the world, protect information from security threats, and can even decide which computers 
receive priority over others.B eyond those basic networking functions, routers come with additional features to make 
networking easier or more secure. Depending on your needs, for example, you can choose a router with a firewall, a 
virtual private network (VPN), or an Internet Protocol (IP) communications system.
