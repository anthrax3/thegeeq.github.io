The practice of coding is one of teaching the computer to do something. The purpose of programming is to create. 
The languages, machines, compilers and interpreters are only tools; brushes to painters. But you want to master
programming, then you must practice it as someone said -

> Practice makes a man perfect.

There are many ways to practice it. But, if you want to master it, you need to practice against someone. That is 
usually done at Hackathons & Other Coding Competitions. Among Hackathons, [Google's Codejam](https://code.google.com/codejam) 
is the best one, and its my dream to participate in that. But, there are Website too which focus on improving coding skills.

So, Today, I'll tell you the best competitive programming sites that I love.

1. 	[Codewars](https://codewars.com)
	It is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on 
	programming challenges known as kata. One of the best I've ever used. It has challenges for more than
	30 programming languages and I use it the most. 
	
2. 	[Codefights](https://codefights.com)
	CodeFights is an American technology company that applies game mechanics to online computer programming 
	challenges for both instructional and recruiting purposes. It's my secondry option. It also
	has challenges for many programming languages and also helps in recruiting.

3. 	[Hackerearth](https://hackerearth.com)
	HackerEarth is a startup technology company based in Bangalore, India that provides recruitment solutions for
	business & spreads the knowledge of coding to individuals & also helps them in recruiting. It's my tertiary
	option. It has challenges as well as tutorials on various topics including Algorithms.
	
4. 	[Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com)
	HackerRank is a technology company that focuses on competitive programming challenges for both consumers 
	and businesses, where developers compete by trying to program according to provided specifications. I used
	it in my childhood to learn some programming concepts & JAVA.
		
5. 	[Coderbyte](https://coderbyte.com)
	Coderbyte is a web application that helps you practice your programming skills, prepare for coding bootcamps,
	and prepare for job interviews with our collection of interview questions, videos, and solutions. It provides
	200+ coding challenges you can solve in an online editor using 10 different programming languages. It also 
	provides official solutions for some of the challenges along with 800,000+ user solutions. 
	It is recommended by the top coding bootcamps.
	
6. 	[Codechef](https://codechef.com)
	CodeChef is a non-profit educational initiative of Directi. It is a global competitive programming platform 
	which supports over 50 programming languages and has a large community of programmers that helps students 
	and professionals test and improve their coding skills. Its objective is to provide a platform for practice,
	competition and improvement for both students and professional software developers. Apart from this, it aims 
	to reach out to students while they are young and inculcate a culture of programming in India.
	
8. 	[Topcoder](https://topcoder.com)
	Topcoder is a company that administers contests in computer programming. Topcoder hosts fortnightly online 
	competitive programming competitions—known as SRMs or "single round matches"—as well as weekly competitions 
	in graphic design and development.
	
7. 	[Codeingame](https://codeingame.com)
	CodinGame is a technology company editing an online platform for developers, allowing them to play with 
	programming with increasingly difficult puzzles, to learn to code better with an online programming 
	application supporting twenty-five programming languages, and to compete in multiplayer programming 
	contests involving timed artificial intelligence, or code golf challenges. It also serves as a 
	recruiting platform, allowing developers to get noticed by companies based on their performance on 
	the contests.
	
9. 	[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
	Project Euler is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved 
	with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics 
	and computer programming.
	
10.	[Programmr](https://programmr.com)
	Programmr is the world's online lab for programming enthusiasts to assess, improve and showcase 
	their programming skills.
	
11. [Codehunt](https://www.codehunt.com)
	Code Hunt is an educational, browser-based coding game developed by Microsoft targeting teachers 
	and students from introductory to advanced programming or software engineering courses. At the 
	core of the game experience is an automated grading engine based on symbolic execution.

That's all the website that I've used. There are many more which serve the same purpose but these
were more than enough for me to learn & improve my coding skills. 

Thanks & Good Bye :-)
