By tweaking the [Windows Registry](#), you can *achieve a superfast speed*
*for shutting down your system.*

*To Open Registry:* Press `windows +r` & type `regedit` & press `enter`.

### THE STEPS

1. Open the Registry Editor.

2. In left pane of Registry Editor, go to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control`

3. In the right pane, right click on `WaitToKillServiceTimeout` and click on `Modify`.

4. Type in a number between 2000-20000 (2-20 seconds) and click on OK.
   *NOTE: The default time is 12000 (12 seconds).*

5. Close regedit.

6. *After rebooting* (restart) Windows the new settings will take effect. The time to wait
   for terminating services will be faster and shutdown wonâ€™t drag on forever.
   
7. If you have problems with programs from your computer shutting down too
   quickly, then repeat the above steps and increase the time (Step 4) a bit.

**Note:** Modifying the registry can cause serious problems that may require you to
reinstall your operating system. I cannot guarantee that problems resulting from
modifications to the registry can be solved.
