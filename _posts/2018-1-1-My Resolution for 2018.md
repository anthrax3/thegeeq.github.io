decided to plan this year's goal for me. Yeah I think that's a funny & I'm funniest of all, as I was born on 1st April.
So Let's start creating the resolution....

1. Purchase a brand new charger for my laptop.
2. Get a Girlfriend. {top priority}
3. Score Good Marks in my Intermediate Finals.
4. Admission in best college.
5. Start a community for Hackers.
6. Hack atleast 500 websites. 
7. Discover some new exploits.
8. Start making more friends.

That's All !!!! But That's a lot <pre></><pre> Especially the second one....

So, If anyone is reading this, Wish me a Good Luck for reaching these goals.
