[The Social Network](#) is a 2010 American biographical drama film *directed
by* David Fincher and *written by* Aaron Sorkin. Adapted from **Ben Mezrich's 
2009 book** *The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook*, 
A Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal, the film portrays the 
founding of social networking website Facebook and the resulting lawsuits.
Really a good one to watch!!!

> You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies.

Harvard student **Mark Zuckerberg** creates the social networking site that would
become known as Facebook, but is later sued by 
**Cameron Winklevoss & Tyler Winklevoss** who claimed he stole their idea, and 
the co-founder **Eduardo Saverin** who was later removed. 

I loved the part where after being dumped for being a douche to his girlfriend, 
Zuckerberg goes back to his dorm, opens up his LiveJournal blog, grabs a beer 
from the fridge, and gets to work.

The sequence goes on for minutes, eventually changing tracks and introducing 
a new key player, Eduardo Saverin, who gives Mark the algorithm that allows 
Facemash to function properly. 

And also, the amazing quotes by **Sean Parker**

> We lived in farms, then we lived in cities, and now we're gonna live on the 
Internet.

> A million dollars isn't cool, you know what's cool? A Billion Dollar.

There are many more moments that I really loved and would take a day long
to describe them.

In conclusion, what I think is that, If Mark had been a little more social 
to begin with, people might not have had to sue him to get his attention.
Then again, if he'd been more social, he probably wouldn't have been 
motivated to invent Facebook.
